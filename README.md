## Description
This repository contains the scripts and data analysis used in the study '*Publication Patterns in the Humanities: Generational Shifts and Changing Research Agendas*'. The research explores the publication behaviors of humanities scholars in Spanish-speaking countries, analyzing approximately 40,000 scholars from 1950 to 2021 using the Dialnet database. The aim is to identify generational shifts and evolving research agendas in humanities publication patterns, with a special focus on the relation between publication formats and research topics.

## Abstract
The humanities have distinct publication practices compared to the sciences, with books and local language literature being essential. This study identifies and analyzes the publication patterns of humanities scholars in Spanish-speaking countries, revealing unique publication behaviors and fostering diverse perspectives rather than linear knowledge progression. Our findings reveal substantial generational shifts towards journal-centric publication patterns, influenced by bibliometric-driven evaluation systems, and a transformation in the relation between publication patterns and research topics. These results highlight the need for more inclusive assessment practices that recognize the diverse nature of humanities scholarship, contributing to discussions on promoting bibliodiversity in research assessment.
